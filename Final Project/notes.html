//In order to make use of ES6 modules which make the code easier to maintain. Some browsers don't support this yet and so we need to use Webpack to bundle them into one file.
//webpack and babel are npm packages
//node.js is an environment in which you can run JS server side. 
//NPM - node package manager (you get this when you download node.js)
//npm init - creates a package.json file in your project
//npm install e.g. npm install webpack --save-dev (the save dev tells it to install webpack as a devDependency of the project).
//two types of node.js packages - librarys/frame works and development tools. Webpack is a development tool whearas, somthing like react is a dependency.  
//to save somthing as a dependency e.g. react just add --save on the end e.g. npm install jquery --save
//npm install takes the packges listed in the package.json file and goes and gets them
//To uninstall - npm uninstall jquery --save

/////////////////////////
//configuring webpack

//webpack also bundles css and images.
//create a webpack.config.js file
//do npm install webpack cli --save-dev (this allows us to run the scripts specified in package.json in the command line).
//to run an npm script - npm run. e.g. npm run dev
//webpack has entry points, outputs, loaders and plugins.

////////////////////////
//webpack development server
// Webpack development server is a dependency that allows realtime updating. --open keeps it updated when you change a file. 
// Webpack 4 has two modes - development and production. Development runs faster. specify these in scripts.
// The src folder is for development only
// The dist folder contains what the user will see
// plugins - allow us to do complicated processing of our input files - plugins do whatever you can't do with a loader.
// html-webpack-plugin allows us to pass the html from the src folder ("the source html") into a new file within dist. 

////////////////////////
//Babel

//babel is a compiler 
//installed three packages: babel-core, babel-preset-env and babel-loader
/Loaders are transformations that are applied on the source code of a module. They allow you to pre-process files as you import or “load” them e.g. changing sass into css.
//babel needs a config file - normally called .babelrc (in this file, the env refers to the -preset-env plugin).
//babel can't change everything back to a previous language because somethings simply didn't exist e.g. promises. //A polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support the feature.
// installed dependency babel-polyfill - this should be an entry point. - all the entry points get bundled together into one js file.

//See MVC image for explination.

//Making our first API call
//api can be found at food2fork.com/about/api
//api key: 21b235db7631a50c6e8f947b9ee51f78
//api keys are used as a password and to track how many requests someone makes.
//axios is a popular http request library - he uses it but really you could just do a fetch request. He uses it because not all browsers support fetch yet and he says axios is also good at error handling. It also does the JSON converting step automatically.

//Building the search model

//buliding search controller
//State is all the data stored in a programme/application at a certain point of time.
//We want all the data the defines our app in one given moment, all in the same place i.e. in one object. 
//Note one event handlers: When the event occurs, an event object is passed to the function as the first parameter. The type of the event object depends on the specified event. For example, the "click" event belongs to the MouseEvent object.
